<H1>Embedded Approaches with QT/QML</H1>
<P>Developers of GUI based systems, using QT, are faced with
consistent challenges:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The ability to develop a GUI independent of the underlying
	application code.
	<LI>The ability to develop underlying application code without a
	functional GUI.
	<LI>The ability to do both simultaneously while actual production
	hardware is being developed, which often leads to working on
	evaluation hardware that may not be full-featured.
</UL>
<P>This paper focuses on some approaches to help the developers
approach the implementation strategy in a way that allows clean
development, debug and deployment of complex products.  The concepts
outlined in this paper provide the following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Simplistic ways to develop the GUI in a target hardware
	agnostic fashion.
	<LI>Simplistic ways to simulate the target runtime code through
	Python scripting; Python scripting serves as a simulator for the
	GUI, allowing easy interaction and updates, as well as GUI
	regression testing.
	<LI>Simplistic ways to <I>drive</I> the target runtime code
	through Python scripting; Python scripting serves as a means to do
	operational testing, as well as controlled regression testing.
</UL>
<H2>Python as a Development Tool</H2>
<P>Although most people will not deploy a product that is completely
Python based, Python serves as a excellent choice for easing the
development cycle for the following reasons:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>It's extremely fast to develop in.
	<LI>Developers with either none or limited Python experience are
	easily able to grasp the approaches and use the language; it is a
	very friendly language to work with.
	<LI>It is host independent; Python can run on x86/Windows
	environments, x86/Linux environments or target ARM/Linux
	environments without any changes.
</UL>
<P>In summary, it's ease of use, and the abundance of online
documentation make it an excellent choice as a development tool, as
scripting is rapidly prototyped, tested and deployed, and it's core
is string based operations, making it easy to interact with.</P>
<H2>QT and QML</H2>
<P>Although QT has been around for  many years, and there are many
product GUI's developed around it, QML is a relatively new player in
recent years.  The advantages of a mixed-mode GUI development
environment are the following:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>QT is C++ based, and although runs reasonably well on both
	Windows and Linux targets, there are some minor quirks on OS layer
	interfaces, such as how to spawn child processes.  Conditional
	compilation takes care of this, allowing a GUI to run under both
	Windows and Linux.
	<LI>QML is completely target agnostic; it's a scripting language,
	and it runs inter-operable in both Windows and Linux based
	environments without change.
</UL>
<P>If QML is adopted as the primary language for development of the
GUI, then the underlying QT, C++ based logic, simply serves as a
foundation for the QML.  Core services in QT/C++ can be developed
that operate under Windows or Linux, and then stable, rarely requires
change, while the bulk of the GUI development efforts lay in QML.</P>
<H1>A Practical Implementation Strategy</H1>
<P>Figure 1 serves as a foundation for discussion of a practical
implementation strategy.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="images/qt_qml_approaches_1.gif"<BR><BR>
<P><B>Figure 1 &#8210; A Practical Implementation Architecture</B></P>
<H2>GUI Core</H2>
<P>The GUI Core is designed to operate under both Windows and Linux. 
It's foundational design is rooted around socket level communications
with some connected server.  Thus, it is a “client” in a
Client/Server model, and operates stateless.  There are really two
modes of development under QT:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Signals and Slots, in a C++ environment.
	<LI>QML, and QML Objects by name.
</UL>
<P>In either case, the point is to abstract these away from binding
with underlying core application services.  However, the preferred
approach is QML, with Objects by name, versus the traditional Single
and Slots model.</P>
<P>In the architecture showing in Figure 1, we have two main
components, with three key sub-components:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>QML Pages.  These provide the actual GUI presentation, as
	well as a series of objects to interact with.
	<LI>The QT/C++ component foundation, which contains three
	sub-components:
	<UL>
	<LI><B>Page Manager:</B> Mainly focused on startup, and launching
	the parent QML Page.
	<LI><B>QML Object Manager: </B>Mainly focused on dealing with
	Objects, by name, in the QML sub-system.
	<LI><B>Session Manager:</B> This provides interaction outside of
	the GUI with the underlying application, as well as application
	simulator.  In this discussion, we focus on this being a component
	that interacts with outside components via Socket level
	communications, with String/Object Name based interactions.
	</UL>
</UL>
<H3>QML Object Manager</H3>
<P>A C++ set of methods responsible for
providing a “bridge” between QML and the connected Server that
provides functional, state-full services.  Listing 1 shows a simple
button that requests a “load” of some data:</P>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">
<pre><code>
    ExmplButton1 {
        buttonText: "Load" 
        id: exmpl_button_Load 
        x: 550 
        y: 530 
        MouseArea { 
            anchors.fill: parent 
            hoverEnabled: true 
            acceptedButtons: Qt.LeftButton | Qt.RightButton 
            onClicked: { 
                info.text = 'Clicked (wasHeld=' + mouse.wasHeld + ')' 
                var exmplString = "get exmplButton" 
                exmpl.updateField( exmplString ) 
            } 
        }
</code></pre>
</FONT></FONT>
<P><B>Listing 1 &#8210; Simple Button to Query</B></P>
<P>This example has two characteristics:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The
	Object Name is <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">exmpl_button_load,</FONT>
	by ID.
	<LI>The
	query to the underlying C++ method in QT is done through
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">exmpl.updateField() </FONT>once
	the button is clicked on.  This passes down the string “<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">get
	exmplButton</FONT>”.  This string is serviced by the Object
	Manager, which, in the end, passes the entire string, intact, to
	some handler via a Socket level connection by the Session Manager.
	<LI>The
	handler then services this request, and returns a response via the
	Session Manager, which then does a reverse lookup by name to find
	the original Object, and then properly handles. Listing 2 shows a
	simple interaction to find the original Object.
</UL>
<P STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">
<pre>><code>
    ExmplButton1 { 
        QObject *qmlTextBox = dataPagesObject->findChild<QObject*>(objectId);   
        if( qmlTextBox ) { 
            qDebug() << "ExmplGui::sessionProcessReadData(): Object Found";
            qDebug() << "Setting Text";
                qmlTextBox->setProperty( "text", QVariant( objectVal ) );
        }
    }
</code></pre>
</FONT></FONT>
<P><B>Listing 2 &#8210; Back Binding to QML by ID</B></P>
<P>Although
specific details are omitted from these listings, there are two key
points:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Strings
	passed down from QML contain an Object ID encoded in them.  In this
	case, it is “<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">exmplButton</FONT>”.
	<LI>Strings
	returned by underlying services contain that Object ID encoded in
	them, thus allowing a reverse lookup from the QT C++ services to
	find the original Object ID, and make changes to the attribute based
	on specific request.  In this case, the underlying, remote connected
	server understood from the passed string to have QT C++ services
	lookup by name “<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">exmpl_button_load</FONT>”.
	 Specifically, the QT C++ looked up the QML Object, by ID, through
	<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">findChild(objectId)</FONT>.
</OL>
<H3>Example String/Object ID Bindings</H3>
<P>On
some sort of query from QML to the underlying application code, and
takes the form of:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">get
objectId=[optional parameters]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>On some sort of “set”, which causes action to happen from the
underlying application code, the string takes the form of:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.49in; text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace"><FONT SIZE=1 STYLE="font-size: 8pt">set
objectId=[parameters, comma separated, which are parsed by underlying
application code]</FONT></FONT></P>
<P>Return strings adhere to the rules, providing easy back binding to original
request.  The result of this is:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>An
	API that is string based, thus allowing the underlying application
	code to be interacted with via Telnet and socket based
	communications.  It imposes constraints, based on Object ID's, which
	lead to consistency in approach and development.
	<LI>Through
	the defined API, which is string based, and interactions done over a
	socket, two things happen:
	<UL>
	<LI>A
	stateless GUI can be developed; it sends strings, responds to
	strings
	<LI>A
	state-full application is developed, which acts on string input
	(commands), and emits string based results.
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>The GUI operates independent of the application code, the application
code operates independent of the GUI.</P>
<H1>Python, Our Development Friend</H1>
<P>The foundation of this approach is how to employ Python to help
with development efforts.  Python is a friendly language, that is
string based, and allows easy Client/Server interactions.  This paper
has focused on string based operations.  This is key to utilization
of Python to help us develop:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>A <B>Python Server</B> can easily be developed which responses
	to string based inquiries from the GUI, via a socket.  Thus, with a
	defined API, the GUI can be developed independent of the
	application, using the defined string based API.  The GUI can be
	developed under Windows or Linux; it doesn't matter.  It's core
	functionality is to serve pages, and simply send requests, and
	respond to those requests.
	<LI>Python scripting serves as a test bed prior to full
	implementation of target logic, allowing developers of the GUI to
	send requests, get expected responses.
	<LI>A series of Python scripts can be developed to “drive”
	the application, either for development, or for regression testing. 
	Envision several Python based tools:
	<UL>
	<LI>A command line interface to sequence the underlying core
	logic of the application.
	<LI>A series of scripts to perform regression testing, from an
	automated build perspective; nightly pulled trees are built,
	installed on the target, and then scripting run to test for valid
	functionality.  Continuous integration.
	<LI>From a day to day development perspective?  Scripting easily
	developed to test various modes of operation of the product.
	</UL>
</UL>
<P>An easily used language for rapid-prototype work, and gives
simplistic approaches to developing both the GUI and application code
independent of each other.</P>
<H1>Summary</H1>
<P>All products contain unique challenges on how they are developed
and deployed.  This paper offers an approach that allows simultaneous
development of a GUI and Application Code while working with the
realities of daily life; multiple groups involved, hardware in flux,
and integration always being the challenge for final deployment.</P>
<P>It's
core concept is design to debug, and design to have clean interfaces
without the complicated bindings that prevent unit testing and clean
deployment.  Often it is easier to develop a GUI under and Windows
based host, without target hardware, while the application code is
developed on the target hardware.</P>
