<P>This paper outlines a hybrid Yocto based build environment
architecture that provides the following features:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Utilization of the Yocto/Poky build environment for managing
	the Root Filesystem, Linux Kernel, U-Boot and proprietary target

<P></P>
<P>Yocto, OpenEmbedded and all associated recipes and meta layers
provide a robust environment for building Root Filesystems, and
managing Open Source Packages.  The recipes associated with this are
well maintained by a large community, and often require little
change.  Thus, Yocto serves well as a package building engine, but it
is not an IDE designed for day to day software development.  In
summary, Yocto serves well to pull Open Source Packages, build, and
then deploy them into a viable Operating System environment.</P>
<P>User Application Code, however, is often much easier to maintain
when built with a standard <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Makefile</FONT>
based build environment.  It allows straight-forward builds in
component directories without <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">bitbake</FONT>
recipes and working within Yocto.  To facilitate this approach, it's
necessary for the User Application Code to have access to the Open
Source libraries and header files, as well as have a “cross
compile” tool chain to use for builds.    The Yocto SDK serves will
to provide these services and infrastructure.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Hybrid Architecture Foundations</H1>
<P>Utilization of Open Source and associated build engines frees the
developer from having to invest time and resources into maintaining
an Operating System baseline; this is done by the community. 
Associated with this is the need to easily be able to pull and
integrate in the never ending set of changes and evolution of all of
these “upstream packages.”   To help achieve an ability to easily
keep current with the community, it's important to maintain a clean
separation between the Operating System environment, and the User
Application Code.  A good analogy to consider in a design approach
would be an Ubuntu based system; its an Operating System, and is
easily maintained and kept current.  But, developers would write
application code that ran under Ubuntu.  They would not make changes
to Ubuntu, but rather, have a set of locally designed and built
packages that ran under Ubuntu.</P>
<P>The architecture in this paper promotes this approach.  Yocto is
used to build the Operating System.  From that, a set of
cross-compile tools exists to develop the User Application Code.  In
the end, the User Application Code is installed into the Operating
System Environment.  The foundational points of this are as follows:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Work with unmodified Yocto, OpenEmbedded and Vendor released
	meta-layers.  Often, what the SoC vendor releases is a meta-layer
	that installs into a stock Yocto release, and builds an image that
	can be installed on vendor supplied evaluation hardware/target(s).</P>
	<LI><P>Perform company specific updates to the stock, unmodified
	releases to allow the basic image to boot on the company specific
	hardware.  This most often best done through a company specific
	meta-layer that installs into the Yocto build environment.  This
	meta-layer appends changes to the original, unmodified upstream
	feeds.</P>
	<LI><P>Deploy a Yocto generated SDK onto the host development
	environment.  This SDK contains libraries, header files and any host
	specific build tools.  It's an environment that allows cross-compile
	and build.</P>
	<LI><P>Develop all User Application Code using the SDK tools, with
	standard <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Makefile</FONT> based
	development.</P>
	<LI><P>Provide scripting to assemble the final image. This takes the
	stock image out of Yocto that boots stand-alone on the target, and
	installs the User Application Code into it.  This also promotes
	building upgrade schemes which are modular by nature.</P>
</OL>
<P>With an approach like this, the build environment becomes
host agnostic; it could run on Ubuntu, CentOS or Fedora.  A more
practical company approach would simply be picking a base like Ubuntu
14.04 LTS as the supported build environment.  But, the key is to
avoid reliance on the host build machine; just like we separate the
ties out between the Operating System, and User Application Code, we
all separate out any ties to the host build environment.  An example
of this would be Python; use the SDK provided Python for any
scripting in the build environment, versus relying on specific needs
on the host build machine.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Operating System Infrastructure</H2>
<P>The Operating System Infrastructure is comprised of the following
components:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>A version of U-Boot that boots on the company specific
	hardware.</P>
	<LI><P>A version of the Linux Kernel that boots on company specific
	hardware.</P>
	<LI><P>A Root Filesystem that contains few or no modifications from
	a stock Yocto build, allowing the system to boot into a login
	prompt.</P>
</UL>
<P>To achieve this, the following steps:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Work with the stock Yocto, vendor and other meta-layers,
	without modification.</P>
	<LI><P>Make any changes to U-Boot and the Kernel for the company
	specific hardware.  This is best done with a company specific
	meta-layer which applies patch sets to U-boot and the Kernel without
	modification of the original upstream sources.  For example, instead
	of modifying any meta-layer recipe, simply use the <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">bbappend</FONT>
	capability of OpenEmbedded to perform localized changes.</P>
	<LI><P>This company specific meta-layer would provide needed drivers
	for FPGA's and other proprietary hardware.</P>
	<LI><P>Work with package groups in Yocto as need be.  For example,
	start with <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">core-image-minimal</FONT>,
	and beef that up to incorporate all other Open Source packages
	needed for the product.  Typically, this would be creating a custom
	Distro in a company specific meta-layer, as well as a company
	specific package group set in the company meta-layer.</P>
</OL>
<P>Through this approach, at any given time, we have the result of an
image and Root Filesystem that can boot stand-alone, without
application code.  Multiple long-term capability can be realized
through this approach:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Taking updates from the Community, such as new versions of
	OpenSSL, are easily done, as no changes were made on original
	source.</P>
	<LI><P>Taking vendor updates are easily accomplished, as not changes
	were done to original source.</P>
	<LI><P>Unit Test Cases are easily developed to qualify the Operating
	System environment.</P>
</UL>
<P>It should also be noted that with an approach like this, U-Boot
can TFTP load the Linux Kernel, and the Linux Kernel and NFS mount
the Root Filesystem.  Once stable, U-Boot requires few changes, it
simply needs to have basic driver support for media and network.  On
a day to day development effort, there is no need to “re-flash” a
target; simply boot everything over the network.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Yocto SDK Utilization</H2>
<P>Yocto has inherent capability to generate an SDK.  This SDK
contains the following:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Cross-compile tools, as well as any host tools that are
	required for part of the User Application Code build.</P>
	<LI><P>It exports Header Files and Libraries required for the build.</P>
	<LI><P>When properly done, provides an environment that has no ties
	to the underlying host build machine.</P>
</OL>
<P>If properly deployed, and coupled with a company specific Distro,
it provides a clean cross-compile environment that allows for
controlled releases of new tools.  An environment is sourced for
builds, and User Application Code simply builds with the environment.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">User Application Code</H2>
<P>Through the approaches outlined in the previous sections, the User
Application Code simply becomes a set of executable applications
which have been compiled against the libraries and header files from
Yocto.  These  executable applications can be installed one by one,
or as a group, on the the target.  They are build without <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">bitbake</FONT>
recipes, and in such, are not tied heavily to the Yocto
infrastructure.</P>
<P>This facilitates a  clean upgrade scheme; without heavy ties to
the Operating System Environment, upgrades can be done in several
means:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Full upgrade, OS infrastructure and application.</P>
	<LI><P>Application only upgrade.</P>
</UL>
<P>But the real power is in day to day development.  Stable targets
with stable Operating Systems environments only require update of the
specific application code components.</P>
<P>More so, the User Application Code is built with a standard
<FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Makefile</FONT> based
environment, avoiding the need for extensive <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">bitbake</FONT>
recipe development.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">A Practical Deployment Approach</H2>
<P>Although past the scope of this paper, the key elements to
consider are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Establish original source and upstream feeds in <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">github</FONT>,
	allowing tracking of changes and updates from the community.</P>
	<LI><P>Establish a company specific meta-layer to performed needed
	changes to unmodified releases from the community.  This meta-layer
	would also be responsible for building proprietary drivers.</P>
	<LI><P>Separate Application Code from Operation System code, thus
	promoting a clean, multi-year approach to maintaining source.</P>
</UL>
<P>And then, utilize a boot-strap scheme to build:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Within <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">github</FONT>,
	have the core build infrastructure.  This is a single point of pull.
	 Within that pull is a master <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Makefile</FONT>.</P>
	<LI><P>This core <FONT FACE="Courier New, monospace">Makefile</FONT>
	then executes to pull in the upstream, put it all into place, and
	execute the complete build.</P>
</OL>
<P>This approach leads well to any continuous integration and build
scheme.</P>
